It  is  there  supposedly  to  help
form the intellectual character of a person and to provide paths to upward mobility. Yet, the process of both defining what counts as literacy and how it should be gained
has  always  had  links  to  particular  regimes  of  morality  as  well. The value of writing, speaking, and listening
should  not  be  seen  as  access  to  “refined  culture”  or  to  “life  skills”  for  our  allotted
(by  whom?) places in  the  paid  and  unpaid labor market,  but  as  a  crucial means  to
gain power and control over our entire lives. This involves a different vision of knowledge and culture. Neither of these concepts
refers  to  a  false  universality,  a  pregiven  consensus  that is  divorced  from  patterns  of
domination and exploitation. Speaking  theoretically,
John  Fiske  reminds  us  of  this:
Knowledge  is  never  neutral,  it  never  exists  in  an  empiricist,  objective  relationship  to  the  real. Knowledge is  power,  and  the  circulation  of  knowledge is  part
of the social distribution of power. The discursive power to construct a commonsense  reality  that  can  be inserted into  cultural  and  political life is  central in  the city.
